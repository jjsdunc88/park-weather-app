# park-weather-app

## Description 

This project was a collaborative work among student developers. We wanted to create an application that would help the user find new places in nature to explore and new locales to experience. The application allows the user to enter any US State intials and search the National Park Service register to return a random State Park or Historic Site along with two local breweries.

In this challenge, we built a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. We utilized third party API's to provide current weather and 5 day forecast data.
