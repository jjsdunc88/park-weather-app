# park-weather-app

## Description 

This project was a collaborative work among student developers. We wanted to create an application that would help the user find new places in nature to explore and new locales to experience. The application allows the user to enter any US State initials and search the National Park Service register to return a random State Park or Historic Site along with two local breweries. This app is useful in providing ideas for different places to visit. This concept allows the user a macro perspective of their experience rather than a focus on minute details.

We chose the CSS Framework Bulma because it is lightweight, platform independent and has good documentation support.
